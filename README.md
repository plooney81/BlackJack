# BlackJack.py
This is an ongoing project for a blackjack game using OOP.
Each card is an object
Each Deck is an object (player chooses how many decks to play with)
Each hand is an object
The player is an object
and finally the dealer is an object.

Once the user types in their name and how many decks they want, the game starts.
The dealer shuffles the X number of decks and starts dealing.
The dealer must stay at 17 or higher and must hit at 16 or lower.
The user obviously has a choice of whether they would like to stay or hit. (user can see the top card in the dealers hand)

-TO DO LIST
add in inheretance and clean up code
incorporate ace cards being 1 or 11 (currently is only 1)
incorporate user being able to split hand into two hands if has two identical cards from the deal.
